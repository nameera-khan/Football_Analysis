# Football_Analysis
**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and clustering player data to group similar players based on their attributes. The clustering results can be used to identify player roles, scout talent, or form balanced teams. The dataset includes player characteristics such as height, weight, ratings, and performance metrics.

**Objectives**

Understand Player Attributes: Analyse features such as finishing, crossing, and overall rating.

Cluster Players: Group players into meaningful clusters using K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering techniques.

Interpret Clusters: Define player roles based on cluster characteristics.

Generate Insights: Provide actionable recommendations for scouting, player improvement, and team formation.

**Project Workflow**

1. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning: Handle missing values by filling them with the mean or other appropriate values.

Standardisation: Normalise numerical features to ensure uniform scaling for clustering.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features (e.g., finishing, crossing, strength).

2. Clustering Analysis

Algorithm Used: K-Means clustering to group players based on their attributes.

Steps:

Identify the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Fit the K-Means algorithm and assign cluster labels.

Analyze cluster centroids to interpret group characteristics.

3. Visualisation

Scatter Plots: Visualise player clusters using selected feature pairs (e.g., finishing vs. crossing).

Cluster Trends: Observe how clusters vary in terms of specific attributes.

4. Insights

Provide actionable insights based on cluster definitions, such as:

Role identification: Forwards, defenders, midfielders, Wingers,etc.
